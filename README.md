# Daily-JavaScript-Alert-String-20180801


Consider the following code:
```javascript
var myString= "Hello World";
alert(myString.length);
```

### What is the output when you run this script in the browser?
A. An alert box displaying the following: ```"Hello World", 11```

B. An alert box displaying the following: ```myString, 11```

C. An alert box displaying the following: ```Hello World```

D. An alert box displaying the following: ```11```

//MY code is self documenting
THE ANSWER IS D


===========================================================
KEY - * CORRECT * : Rock On!

Note this line here ```alert(myString.length);``` all I am printing is the length of the String so you *know* it's going to be a number.

The String "Hello World" is 11 characters long, thus the correct answer as to what will be displayed is '11'.
